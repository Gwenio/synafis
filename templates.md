## Doxyfile

Doxyfile is a partial configuration for Doxygen documentation program.

Copy it into the root directory of the project and then modify any setting desired.

Either run 'doxygen Doxyfile' or 'doxywizard Doxyfile' in the root directly to generate the documentation.

Doxywizard can be used to adjust settings with a graphical interface rather than editing the file manually.

It is recommended to set HAVE_DOT to yes if you have Graphviz installed and then set DOT_PATH to the directory containing dot.
